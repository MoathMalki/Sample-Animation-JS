A simple interface in Java Script and HTML displays the colors and how they change every two seconds. 

When you press the start button, it gives a random color to the button, and after two seconds it gives a random color to the background, and after every two seconds the background color changes again, and every time you press the start button, the speed at which the background color changes increases.
